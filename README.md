# Notes about the technical assessment
`Please make use of a frontend JavaScript frame work` and `this system is designed for phones`, That is the reason why I used Ionic (angular).
In the "Bonus Points" section, one of the bullet-points states this: `Scalable UI (Desktop, Tablet and Mobile)` but within the objective, a statement sort of fights with said bullet point... the statement being:  `Styles need to be put into place to stop the main view from getting too wide.`. I favoured the bonus points statement.
